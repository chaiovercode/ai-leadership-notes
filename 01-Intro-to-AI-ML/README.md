## 1. What is AI?

**Definition:** AI is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

These tasks include:
*   Visual perception (Computer Vision)
*   Speech recognition (ASR/NLP)
*   Decision-making (Strategy/Planning)
*   Translation between languages

**Core Concept:** It is not "magic". It is math + data + compute.

## 2. AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

The "Russian Doll" Analogy:

*   **Artificial Intelligence (The Box):** The broad umbrella term. Includes rule-based systems (classic "Good Old Fashioned AI") and modern learning systems.
*   **Machine Learning (The Midpoint):** A subset of AI where machines act without being explicitly programmed. They learn from data.
    *   *Traditional:* "If rain, then take umbrella."
    *   *ML:* "Based on 10 years of weather data, there is an 80% chance of rain, so I suggest an umbrella."
*   **Deep Learning (The Core):** A subset of ML inspired by the human brain (neural networks). It automates feature extraction. It excels at unstructured data (images, text).

## 3. History and Evolution of AI

AI is not new. It has gone through "Summers" (hype) and "Winters" (funding freeze).

*   **1956 (The Birth):** The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined at the Dartmouth Conference.
*   **1950s-1970s (Symbolic AI):** Logic-based systems. Good at chess, bad at recognizing a cat.
*   **1980s (Expert Systems):** Rule-heavy systems for industries (e.g., diagnosing blood infections). Rigid and brittle.
*   **1990s-2000s (Statistical Machine Learning):** The rise of probability. Spam filters, Google Search.
*   **2012 (The Deep Learning Boom):** AlexNet wins ImageNet. GPUs (NVIDIA) make Neural Networks viable.
*   **2017 (The Transformer Era):** "Attention Is All You Need" paper gives birth to modern LLMs (BERT, GPT).
*   **2022+ (Generative AI):** ChatGPT brings AI to the masses.

## 4. AI in Business Today

AI has moved from the "Innovation Lab" to the "P&L".

### The Shift
*   **Old View:** AI is for tech giants (Google, Facebook) to optimize ads.
*   **New View:** AI is a general-purpose utility for every department.

### Key Drivers of Adoption
1.  **Democratization:** You don't need a PhD. You need an API key.
2.  **Cost Reduction:** Inference costs are dropping ~10x every year.
3.  **Data Maturity:** Companies finally have data in the cloud (Snowflake, Databricks) ready to be used.

### The "Jagged Frontier"
AI is uneven. It is superhuman at some tasks (coding, summarizing) and below average at others (planning complex events, reliable math). Leaders must know where the frontier lies.

# Applications of AI in Business

> "AI won't replace you. A person using AI will replace you."

This module explores how AI is reshaping specific business functions. The goal isn't just "automation" (doing the same thing cheaper), but "augmentation" (doing new things we couldn't do before).

## 1. AI for Personal Use

### The "Centaur" Model
Combining Human Intuition + AI Horsepower.
*   **The Blank Page Problem:** Use AI to draft the first 80% of emails, memos, or strategies.
*   **The Universal Intern:** Summarizing 50-page reports, converting meeting notes into action items, or preparing for tough negotiations.
*   **Tools:** ChatGPT Plus, Perplexity (for search), Otter.ai (meeting transcription).

## 2. AI for Programming

### The Great Leveler
You no longer need to know syntax to build software. You need to know *logic*.
*   **For Developers:** GitHub Copilot acts as a pair programmer, writing boilerplate code, unit tests, and documentation. Increases velocity by 30-50%.
*   **For Non-Technical Leaders:** You can now build prototypes, dashboards, and automations (SQL queries, Python scripts) using natural language.
*   **Risk:** "Code bloat" and security vulnerabilities if code is not reviewed.

## 3. AI in Customer Journey

From "Mass Marketing" to "Mass Personalization".

*   **Awareness (Marketing):** Generative AI creates thousands of ad variations (image + copy) to test what works.
*   **Consideration (Sales):** AI Agents (SDRs) research prospects and draft hyper-personalized outreach emails (no more generic spam).
*   **Support (Post-Sales):**
    *   *Old:* "Press 1 for English."
    *   *New:* AI Voice Agents that understand intent, handle refunds, and speak 50 languages fluently.

## 4. AI in Product

### AI-Enabled vs. AI-Native
*   **AI-Enabled:** Adding a "Summarize" button to Microsoft Word. It improves an existing workflow.
*   **AI-Native:** A product that couldn't exist without AI. Example: **Midjourney** (Art), **Sunno** (Music), or **Narrativ** (Storytelling).

### The Feature Trap
Don't just add a chatbot to your app. Solves a specific user problem where intelligence was the bottleneck.

## 5. AI in Finance

*   **Fraud Detection:** Traditional rules (if > $10k, flag it) miss nuance. AI analyzes behavior patterns (mouse movement, typing speed, transaction graphs) to catch fraud in real-time.
*   **Algorithmic Trading:** Analyzing alternative data sources (satellite imagery of parking lots, sentiment analysis of news) to predict stock movements.
*   **FP&A:** Automating the "variance analysis" report. "Why did we miss the budget?" — AI can drill down into the ERP data to interpret the root cause.

---

## 6. AI in Operations and Supply Chain

*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Sensors on machines listen for "weird noises" (vibrations). AI predicts failure *weeks* before it happens, preventing downtime.
*   **Demand Forecasting:** Moving from simple trends (Sales last year + 5%) to complex modeling (Weather + Local Events + Social Media Trends).
*   **Route Optimization:** UPS/FedEx saving millions of miles by dynamically adjusting routes based on real-time traffic and AI predictions.
